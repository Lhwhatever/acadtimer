# Timer App
This is a small web app that acts as a custom timer with functionality to play music, and so on. Intended for use with exam revision.

## Current Functionality
1. You can set duration based on presets (1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 2.25 h, 3 h).
2. You can choose whether to start the timer on a countdown, or wait for a countdown (based on presets: 3 s, 5 s, 10 s, 15 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 3 min, 5 min).
3. You can type text to be displayed on the page of the timer.
4. Timer controls are hidden to minimise distractions. You can operate the timer either by:
	* Switching to the window with the timer controls.
	* Use keyboard shortcuts (`Space` to play/pause, `S` to stop).
5. Choose between a count-up or count-down timer.
6. Choose whether to change the background colour of the timer at the last 15 minutes.
7. Choose whether to play a siren at the last 15 minutes.
8. Change the interval at which the timer window refreshes, between 10 and 500 ms (default: 200 ms).
9. Save, restore and reset the above settings.

## Planned Functionality
1. Play music together with the timer.
